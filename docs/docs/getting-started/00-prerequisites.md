# Prerequisites

We start with the following assumptions:

1. You have a host web application that you'd like to add end-to-end encryption to,
   that can run locally on your machine.

2. You have Docker installed, with Docker compose v2 support _(while it's not mandatory for production deployments, we will use it to get started)_.
